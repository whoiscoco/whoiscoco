## Contact

It is preferable that all enquiries be made using the email below. Please allow for 24 hours notice for a booking. The ideal contact will include your full name, date and time you would like to see me, how long you would like to spend with me and an brief introduction about yourself with any expectations or requests or questions you you may have.

Due to Victorian laws, I can only provide outcalls. Please note that if you request incalls your email will be largely ignored. I visit 4 and 5 star hotels with appropriate security. I maintain my professionalism and am a firm believer in discretion. I believe discretion shall work both ways.
