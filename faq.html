## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Are you fully independent?

I am 100% independent, so when you contact me, you’re really emailing me.

#### Are your rates negotiable?

No, please do not ask for a discounted rate as it is disrespectful to my standards.

#### Do you offer incalls?

My service is outcall only. Please do not request incalls as your email may not be responded to and incalls are illegal in Victoria.

#### What makes you stand out from other escorts in Melbourne?

Escorting is a pathway to pleasure for me and I am not dependent on it for my livelihood. My personality,interests and kinks are all of my own.

#### What type of man do you like meeting?

I enjoy seeing refined and confident men who can appreciate every detail of a woman, not utilising an escort for her orifices. Looks, occupation, age and experience are irrelevant to me. A respectful attitude is very important.

#### What type of man do you not like meeting?

I do not enjoy seeing men that are intoxicated or heavily affected by drugs. A large turn off is time wasting, vague queries and tentative bookings and poor hygiene.

#### What will you wear to our meeting?

I enjoy keeping classy in my day to day attire. I have an extensive wardrobe consisting of designer dresses through to my favourite pair of jeans. I have a large, extensive wardrobe so please feel free to request a special outfit. I will never arrive to a hotel or be seen in public in overally revealing clothing that would arouse suspicions.

#### How would you describe your personality?

I have been described as a confident, intelligent woman with high ambition but a very sweet, mysterious personality. I am always exploring new ideas and attempting to improve myself; whether it be in the pursuit of knowledge or trying new things.

#### Do you have an age limit?

My clients are on average between 30 and 60 years of age, however, as long as you’re a respectful individual – age is not a factor.

#### Why haven’t you responded to my email yet?

If I have not responded within 36 hours I am probably swept up with my studies, have not received your contact for some reason or your initial email was offensive. I do try my best to respond to all emails I receive, but if I haven’t replied, and your initial contact was respectful and clear, please send me a quick follow up email.

#### Can I speak to you on the phone beforehand?

At the moment I do not give out my phone number to new clients due to an overwhelming level of enquiry. Once you have seen me or have secured a booking, I’m happy to provide a phone number to contact me for future bookings.

#### Can you organise a hotel for our date?

Organisation of the room for our date is your responsiblity as Victorian law disallows incalls, I also cannot book a hotel on your behalf.

My personal favourites in Melbourne include: The Hilton South Wharf Suites, The Art Series Hotels (particularly the Cullen), Crown Towers and Crown Metropol.

#### Do you accept credit cards?

Unfortunately I do not accept credit cards. If obtaining the required amount of cash discreetly is difficult you can always obtain a gift voucher for me from the following stores – Coles/Myer, David Jones.
